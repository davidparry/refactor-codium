# Spring Boot Refactoring Demo with Codium.ai

## Overview

This Java Spring Boot project serves as a live coding demonstration for showcasing the capabilities of the Codium.ai plugin in refactoring Java codebases, specifically within the Spring Boot framework. The aim is to illustrate how Codium.ai can assist developers in improving code quality, enhancing performance, and modularizing their Java applications.

## Features

- **Code Quality Enhancement:** Learn how Codium.ai identifies and helps eliminate code smells, enhances code readability, and enforces best practices within a Spring Boot application.

- **Performance Optimization:** Discover how Codium.ai can pinpoint performance bottlenecks and provide recommendations to enhance your application's speed and efficiency.

- **Modularization:** See how Codium.ai aids in breaking down a monolithic codebase into more manageable, loosely-coupled modules, promoting code reusability and maintainability.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local development environment.
   
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spring-boot-codiumai-demo.git
   ```

2. Set up your development environment with Codium.ai and the necessary Java development tools.

3. Follow along with the live coding demonstration during the talk to see how Codium.ai is applied to refactor the Spring Boot application.

4. Experiment with Codium.ai to explore further refactoring possibilities and optimize the codebase.
